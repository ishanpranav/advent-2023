# Advent of Code 2023
This is a collection of solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) programming problems implemented in the C programming languages. I have done my best to minimize time complexity while keeping the average running time on the order of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 milliseconds). 

Some of the more difficult problems were implemented in a higher-level programming language before being converted to C. The equivalent code is included here as a reference.

## Acknowledgements
Some of the most challenging problems in this repository were solved with help from Iris Lim. Others are based on the implementations in [this](https://github.com/Hudinid/AdventOfCode2023) repository by Brian Hu.
